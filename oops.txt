OOPS: Object Oriented Programming Systems : black box testing , functional testing
==========================================
1) class : is an collection of data member(variable) and member function (process, methods) with its behaviors
sy :
	class classname
	{
		data member;
		member function;
	}
2) object : instances of an class 
	:to create an memory of an class
	:to access the whole properties of an class except private
sy :
	classname objectname=new classname();

3) encapsulation : data hiding : wrapping up of data into single unit
	private your data member or member function

4) inheritance : properties of parent class extends into child class
	:main purpose is  reusablity , extendsiblity
	:there are mainly 5 types
	1) single
	2) multilevel
	3) hierarchical
	4) multiple: java does not support
	5) hybrid : java does not support

5) polymorphism : ability to take one name having different forms
	: many forms or multiple forms 
	:there are mainly 2 types
	1) compile time (method overloading)
	2) run time (method overriding)

6) abstraction : data hiding :
	:only essential part should be display and rest of the part will be hide
